SharpestMinds Project Series Part 5: Labelling and Encoding Categorical Variables
*********************************************************************************

If you are new to this post and would like some context, I'd highly suggest you read through the previous posts of this project series, as this is the sixth post of this series:

* `Part 1 - Introduction <{filename}./sharpestminds-project-part-1.rst>`_
* `Part 2 - Background, Loading, EDA <{filename}./sharpestminds-project-part-2.rst>`_
* `Part 3 - More Exploratory Data Analysis <{filename}./sharpestminds-project-part-3.rst>`_
* `Part 4 - Dropping Data <{filename}./sharpestminds-project-part-4.rst>`_
* `Part 5 - Categorical Data Encoding <{filename}./sharpestminds-project-part-5.rst>`_

In the previous post, we completed the necessary preprocessing methods that were required of dealing a variety of categorical data types (nominal, binary, and ordinal) and developed an encompassing transformation at the end to encode the mappings for our data points that remained after the initial preprocessing steps. During the previous post, we separated the numeric data from our categorical data to first work with the categorical features. This is the sixth post of my SharpestMinds project series talk about missing data values and how to come up with a smarter way to go about dealing with them. If you want to follow along with the full codebase, you can do so at the `link to the repo <https://github.com/SJHH-Nguyen-D/sharpestminds-project>`_). This is going to be a brief but insightful one, so let's get into it. 

============================
Imputation of Missing Values
============================

You have missing values in your dataset. Now what?

.. code-block:: python3

   code code code
    

Output:

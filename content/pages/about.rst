:summary: A foreword about the author.

My name is Dennis Nguyen-Do. 
I’ve dabbled with web development, desktop scripting, pygame developement and reinforcement learning in the recent past. My academic background consists of a Bachelor of Arts in Public Health, a master's in eHealth/Health Informatics at McMaster University, many MOOCs, and many, many `towardsdatascience <https://towardsdatascience.com/>`_ articles and tutorials.

As an avid independent learner and lover of analytics, I dove into the world of data science some 4 odd years ago, having first exposure through my undergraduate and graduate statistics courses. Through a combination of database management, data mining, machine learning and programming MOOCs/class courses, and the amazing power of the internet, I have been able to get to where I am today in my career. 

As a data scientist who took the non-traditional computer science/engineering/physics/maths route into the field, I have much to learn from the principles from those disciplines but also offer a different perspective based on my health-related academic pedigree. One of my biggest influences and inspirations is entrepeneur and machine learning educator, Siraj Raval. Another one of my biggest influences in my career is Michael Kennedy of the TalkPython podcast.


Outside of data science, I am a big into both educational and comedy podcasts. I've also been known to tinker around in odd jobs such as renovation, helping out with backyard construction, dog walking, and sometimes people watching! People are so interesting... Why do they do what they do and who exactly are people? A topic for another day!

With this personal blog, I intend to share my projects I’m currently working on or have worked on in the past,
partly also as a way of establishing an archive. If you find anything interesting, feel absolutely 
free to get in touch with me through email or my social media.
